  Brandi Smith
  I'm taking this class as an opportunity to break into tech and gain employment in the tech world.
  Some of my hobbies include Gardening, Traveling and Creating art.
  Some of my long term goals are to find my niche in tech, to be in a position in tech to be able to reach back and help others.
